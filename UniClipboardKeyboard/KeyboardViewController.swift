/// Principal class for the UniClip custom keyboard. iOS instantiates this
/// (`NSExtensionPrincipalClass = $(PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME).KeyboardViewController`)
/// when the user switches to the UniClip keyboard. It subclasses
/// `UIInputViewController` — the keyboard analog of a view controller — and
/// hosts a SwiftUI sheet via `UIHostingController`, mirroring the Share
/// Extension's `ShareViewController` approach.
///
/// The keyboard's job is clipboard *sync*, not text entry. On appear it:
///   1. reads the device pasteboard and pushes anything new to the active
///      server (**uplink** — "open keyboard = auto-sync"); and
///   2. pulls the server's latest clipboard and offers it as a one-tap
///      insert candidate (**downlink** — `insertText`, no pasteboard hop).
///
/// Both halves need **Full Access** (`RequestsOpenAccess=YES` + the user's
/// "允许完全访问" toggle): without it, `UIPasteboard` and `URLSession` are
/// both unavailable to a keyboard, so we render a "needs Full Access" hint
/// instead. The first content read after Full Access is granted fires iOS's
/// per-app "允许粘贴" prompt once; after the user allows, reads are silent —
/// which is exactly what makes the auto-sync feel automatic.
